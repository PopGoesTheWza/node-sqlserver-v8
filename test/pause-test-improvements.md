# Pause Test Suite Improvements

## Summary of Changes

The pause.test.js file has been refactored to improve maintainability, readability, and reliability. These tests are valuable as they validate the pause/resume functionality from the previous driver implementation.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Configuration Constants**
- Extracted magic numbers into named constants at the top of the file
- Makes it easier to adjust test parameters globally
- Examples: `LARGE_QUERY_ROWS`, `PAUSE_INTERVAL`, `RESUME_DELAY`

### 2. **Query Templates**
- Created a `QUERIES` object containing all SQL queries used in tests
- Eliminates duplication and makes queries easy to modify
- Centralizes query definitions for better maintenance

### 3. **Helper Functions**
- **`countQueryRows()`**: Async helper to count total rows from a query
- **`createRowCountingQuery()`**: Factory function that creates queries with built-in row counting and event handling
- Reduces code duplication and makes tests more readable

### 4. **Better Test Organization**
- Grouped related tests using nested `describe` blocks:
  - `basic pause/resume functionality`
  - `edge cases`
  - `query interaction`
  - `connection handling`
  - `performance`
- Makes it easier to find and understand specific test scenarios

### 5. **Improved Async Handling**
- Converted some tests to use async/await pattern where appropriate
- Better error handling with proper promise rejection
- More reliable test execution

### 6. **Logging Control**
- Added conditional logging based on `DEBUG_TESTS` environment variable
- Tests run silently by default, reducing noise
- Easy to enable debug logging when needed: `DEBUG_TESTS=1 npm test`

### 7. **Descriptive Test Names**
- Changed from imperative style ("pause a large query") to declarative style ("should pause a large query")
- Added context to assertions with descriptive messages
- Better describes what each test validates

### 8. **Consistent Error Handling**
- All tests now properly handle errors in callbacks
- Uses `assert.ifError()` consistently
- Proper error propagation in promise-based tests

## Benefits

1. **Easier Maintenance**: Constants and helpers make it simple to update test behavior
2. **Better Debugging**: Organized structure and conditional logging help identify issues
3. **More Reliable**: Improved async handling reduces flaky tests
4. **Self-Documenting**: Clear test names and organization explain the functionality
5. **DRY Principle**: Helper functions eliminate code duplication

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run normally (silent)
npm test test/pause.test.js

# Run with debug logging
DEBUG_TESTS=1 npm test test/pause.test.js

# Run specific test group
npm test test/pause.test.js -- --grep "edge cases"
```

## Test Coverage

The refactored test suite maintains full coverage of the original scenarios:
- Basic pause/resume operations
- Cancel operations on paused queries
- Edge cases (multiple pauses, pause after completion)
- Query interaction (new queries with paused queries)
- Connection handling with paused queries
- Performance validation

All original test cases have been preserved while improving their implementation.
